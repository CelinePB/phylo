#phylo

Helper scripts for phylogenetics. See the wiki for some workflows.

###Useful libraries

[Biopython](http://biopython.org/): Lots of useful libraries and functions for doing bioinformatics in Python.

[p4](http://p4.nhm.ac.uk): Peter Foster's Python package for phylogenetics. Implements complex substitution models, supertree methods, and a lot more.

[Gram](http://gram.nhm.ac.uk): Another Peter Foster package. Programmatically draw phylogenetic trees (and in principle other simple vector graphics) with LaTeX and Python.
